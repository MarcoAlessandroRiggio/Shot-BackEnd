# Shot-BackEnd
Firebase function for Shot Project

Before work with this repo you need to make some step:

  - Once you have Node.js and npm installed, install the Firebase CLI via npm:
  
    `npm install -g firebase-tools`
    
    This installs the globally available firebase command. If the command fails, you may need to [change npm permission](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)
    
  - It's a good practice to frequently update both the Firebase CLI and the SDK with these commands inside the functions folder of your Firebase project
  
    `npm install firebase-functions@latest firebase-admin@latest --save`

This code is written starting from [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)
